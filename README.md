This is a project created by Abraham Ibharunujele
and Lawson Ibukun 

The _printf() is a function that works like the printf() function in C standard library which performs formatted output conversion and prints data to the standard output. _printf() imitiates some basic features and functions of printf() as found in the man 3 printf.
The prototype of the _printf() function is:

    int _printf(const char *format, ...);
